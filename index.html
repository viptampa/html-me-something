<h1>Work</h1>

<p>I drive 2 hours each way for work, 5 days a week.  I work for an organization called Community Health Centers as a network administrator of a small enterprise.  The organization provides health care to the unders served in the Orlando metro area.  They have 12 locations and provide family, pediactric, dental, and vision care. You can see their website here at:  www.chcfl.org </p>
<p>Founded in 1972, West Orange Farmworkers Health Association founded by local farm workers, consumer activists and the Sisters of Notre Dame saw the need to help the underprivileged in the area.  The have continuely added new location and services over the past 40+ years. </p>

<p>It is my resposibility to not only maintain the computer network, but also the phone system and connectivity to the world.  Each site has dual private wan connections to a centralized office and a enterprise fiber 100Mbps internet connection.  The equipment I deal with on a day to day is not industry standard and it was a lucky match for both my employer and myself.  I enjoy my job and I like the working up to the challenges of the job. 

<p>
One of the reasons I decided to take this course is to expand my tool set to allow me to be a better voice and network administrator.  Python is a staple in the network industry, and I'd love to develop some networking tools that are browser based.
